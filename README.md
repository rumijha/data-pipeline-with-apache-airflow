## Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow


#### Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has decided to introduce automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines. The data used resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs that tell about user activity on the app, and JSON metadata about the songs the users are listen to. The goal is to create an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow.


#### Project Description
In this project, I have used Apache Airflow to build an ETL pipeline that can be monitored and allows easy backfills. The pipeline consists of custom Airflow operators that fetch data from AWS S3, load it into AWS Redshift staging tables, process the staging data, and load it into fact and dimensions tables. Finally, the data quality check operator is used to find if there are any data discrepancies.

I have also defined a set of tasks and their dependencies to achieve a coherent and sensible data flow within the pipeline. The flow of the tasks within the DAG is as shown below:\

#### Datasets
Datasets used in this project consist of JSON files that reside in pulic access S3 buckets. Below are the S3 links for each:
* Song data (contains the details of the song and its artists): s3://udacity-dend/song_data
* Log data (contains the details of users which tell what songs are being played): s3://udacity-dend/log_data

###### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset:\
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json\
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.\
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

###### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset:\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json\

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### Database Design

##### Staging Tables

* *staging_events_table_create* - stores log_data on Redshift\
artist, auth, firstName, gender, iteminSession, lastName, length, level, location, method, page, registration, sessionid, song, status, ts, userAgent, userid

* *staging_songs_table_create* - stores song_data on Redshift\
num_songs, artist_id, artist_latitude, artist_longitude, artist_location, artist_name, song_id, title, duration, year

##### Fact Table
* *songplays* - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong\
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

##### Dimension Tables
* *users* - users in the app\
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

* *songs* - songs in music database\
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

* *artists* - artists in music database\
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

* *time* - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units\
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


#### Project Files

* *udac_example_dag.py* - It is the main DAG which has its tasks and their dependencies defined.
* *create_tables.sql* - DDL of fact and dimension tables.

###### operators
* *stage_redshift.py* - Defines StageToRedshiftOperator to copy JSON data from S3 to staging tables in the Redshift via copy command.
* *load_dimension.py* - Defines LoadDimensionOperator to load a dimension table from staging table(s).
* *load_fact.py* - Defines LoadFactOperator to load fact table from staging table(s).
* *data_quality.py* - Defines DataQualityOperator to run data quality checks on all tables passed as parameter.

###### helpers
* *sql_queries.py* - Contains SQL queries for the ETL pipeline.


#### How To Run the Project
Enable the DAG in Airflow and it should begin processing.
