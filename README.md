## Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow


#### Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has decided to introduce automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines.\
The data used resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs that tell about user activity on the app, and JSON metadata about the songs the users are listen to.\
The goal is to create an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow.


#### Project Description
In this project, I have used Apache Airflow to build an ETL pipeline from reusable tasks that can be monitored and allows easy backfills.\
The pipeline consists of four operators that fetch data from the S3 bucket and loads it to redshift staging tables, Process the staging data, and load it to the fact and dimensions table. Finally, the data quality checks operator is used to find if there are any data discrepancies.\
I have also defined a set of tasks and their dependencies to achieve a coherent and sensible data flow within the pipeline.


#### Datasets
Datasets used in this project resides in pulic access S3 bucket.Below are the S3 links for each:\
      Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data\
      Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data\
The datasets are JSON files namely song_data and log_data

###### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.\
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json\
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.\
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

###### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json\
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
song_data holds the details of the song and its artists\
log_data hold the details of users which tell what songs is being heard and others

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### Database Design

#### Staging Tables
**staging_events_table_create** - Hold the data of the log dataset on Redshift
* *artist, auth, firstName, gender, iteminSession, lastName, length, level, location, method, page, registration, sessionid, song, status, ts, userAgent, userid*

**staging_songs_table_create** - Holds the data of the song dataset on Redshift
* *num_songs, artist_id, artist_latitude, artist_longitude, artist_location, artist_name, song_id, title, duration, year*

#### Fact Table
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
* *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

#### Dimension Tables
**users** - users in the app
* *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

**songs** - songs in music database
* *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

**artists** - artists in music database
* *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
* *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*


#### Project Files
The project has two directories- dags and plugins and a create tables script.

**dags directory**
* *udac_example_dag* It is the main DAG which has its tasks and their dependencies defined.

**plugins directory**
It consists of Operators and Helpers
###### operators
* *stage_redshift.py* - Defines StageToRedshiftOperator to copy JSON data from S3 to staging tables in the Redshift via copy command.
* *load_dimension.py* - Defines LoadDimensionOperator to load a dimension table from staging table(s).
* *load_fact.py* - Defines LoadFactOperator to load fact table from staging table(s).
* *data_quality.py* - Defines DataQualityOperator to run data quality checks on all tables passed as parameter.
###### helpers
* *sql_queries.py* - Contains SQL queries for the ETL pipeline.

*create_tables.sql* - DDL of fact and dimension tables.


#### How To Run the Project
Enable the DAG in Airflow and it should begin processing.
